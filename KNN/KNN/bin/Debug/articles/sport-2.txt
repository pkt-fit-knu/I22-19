Wales swept past Russia with a breathtaking display in their final group game at Euro 2016 to reach the knockout stages of a major tournament for only the second time in their history.

Aaron Ramsey's beautiful clipped finish put Wales ahead before Neil Taylor scored his first international goal as Chris Coleman's side seized control with an inspired first-half performance.

There was no let-up in the second half as the irrepressible Gareth Bale struck to become the tournament's leading scorer with three goals.

England's goalless draw against Slovakia in Saint-Etienne means Wales progress as Group B winners and will face the third-placed team from Group A, C or D.

News of the England result filtered through to the Toulouse crowd a couple of minutes after the final whistle, adding to the sense of disbelieving euphoria among Wales' raucous supporters.
Playing in their first European Championship, Wales take their place in the knockout stages of an international competition for the first time since a goal by Pele saw them beaten by Brazil in the 1958 World Cup quarter-finals.

There was security in the knowledge a draw was probably enough, while even a defeat coupled with an English win against Slovakia could have seen them progress as one of the best third-placed teams.

Yet Coleman and his players did not want to rely on anyone else. With their destiny in their own hands, Wales wanted to take care of business in Toulouse.

They did so in spectacular fashion, overwhelming a ponderous Russia side with one of the most impressive performances in Welsh football history.
